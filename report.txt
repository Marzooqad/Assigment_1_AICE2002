Task 1
• Describe what you did you make train/valid/test sets
– There is no one right answer, this depends on how you
setup your experiments
– Justify your decision
– Some ideas are provided under task 1

Task 2
• Describe how you pre-processed the data
– There is no one right answer, this depends on how you
setup your experiments
– Justify your decision
– Some ideas are provided under task 2
– You can decide to pre-process your data before or after
you divide into train/valid/test splits. Justify your
decisions

Task 3
• Describe which algorithms you use in your experiments
– You are required to compare at least 2
– There is no one right answer, this depends on how you
setup your experiments
– Justify your decision
– Some ideas are provided under task 3
– Recommend using ones we have covered in class, but
you are not limited. Whatever you choose, justify it

Task 4
• Describe what you did with the data across the 3 datasets
– Did you make one large dataset
– Did you experiment on them individually
– Describe what you did and why

Task 5
• How did you evaluate performance?
– Did you use a confusion matrix?
– Show it in your report
• https://scikitlearn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion
_matrix.html
– Did you use accuracy, F1, Precision, Recall, etc?
– Did you use Area Under Curve or ROC plots?
– Show it in your report and discuss why you chose one over another
and what you observe


Task 6
• What hyperparameters did you explore?
– Tons of ways to address this (k-fold, algorithms, etc)
– Report what you did, what the results are, why you
chose to explore certain parameters, etc

Task 7
• Reflect on your experiment design and results
• What else would you try if you had more time
• Did your experiments answer the research question, why or
why not?
• This should be your ‘conclusion’ of your report
