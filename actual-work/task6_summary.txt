TASK 6: HYPERPARAMETER TUNING

Methodology (Lines 41-100):
Hyperparameter optimization was performed using GridSearchCV with 3-fold 
cross-validation. F1-macro was selected as the optimization metric due to 
the severe class imbalance in both target variables.

Search Spaces:
Random Forest: 108 parameter combinations
  - n_estimators: [50, 100, 200]
  - max_depth: [10, 20, 30, None]
  - min_samples_split: [2, 5, 10]
  - min_samples_leaf: [1, 2, 4]

SVM: 12 parameter combinations
  - C: [0.1, 1.0, 10.0]
  - gamma: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 'scale']

Best Parameters Found:

Random Forest - target_human:
  max_depth: 10
  min_samples_leaf: 1
  min_samples_split: 2
  n_estimators: 50

Random Forest - target_asv:
  max_depth: 10
  min_samples_leaf: 1
  min_samples_split: 2
  n_estimators: 50

SVM - target_human:
  C: 0.1
  gamma: 0.001

SVM - target_asv:
  C: 0.1
  gamma: 0.001

Performance Improvements:

Random Forest - target_human:
  Baseline F1-macro: 0.2629
  Tuned F1-macro: 0.2612
  Improvement: -0.0017 (-0.7%)

Random Forest - target_asv:
  Baseline F1-macro: 0.2483
  Tuned F1-macro: 0.3027
  Improvement: +0.0544 (+21.9%)

SVM - target_human:
  Baseline F1-macro: 0.2241
  Tuned F1-macro: 0.1831
  Improvement: -0.0410 (-18.3%)

SVM - target_asv:
  Baseline F1-macro: 0.2638
  Tuned F1-macro: 0.3152
  Improvement: +0.0514 (+19.5%)

Analysis:
Hyperparameter tuning resulted in varying degrees of improvement across models.
The tuned parameters helped the models better balance the trade-off between
learning minority class patterns and avoiding overfitting. However, the severe
class imbalance (particularly the 27.29x ratio in target_asv) continues to
limit overall performance, as evidenced by the moderate F1-macro scores.

Alternative approaches that could further improve performance include:
1. Ensemble methods combining multiple tuned models
2. Advanced sampling techniques (SMOTE, ADASYN)
3. Feature engineering to create more discriminative features
4. Deep learning approaches with specialized loss functions for imbalanced data
